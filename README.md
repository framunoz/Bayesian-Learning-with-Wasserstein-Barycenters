# Bayesian Learning with Wasserstein Barycenters
Library to reproduce results from the paper with the same name. It provides the code to perform a Stochastic Gradient Descent over Wasserstein Space (WSGD) for the calculation of population Wasserstein barycentres, and more specifically, for Bayesian Wasserstein barycentres.

# Example
There are many examples of the using in the folder [examples](examples/)
